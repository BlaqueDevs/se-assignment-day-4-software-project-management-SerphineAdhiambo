Customer Collaboration: Encourages continuous feedback to align with user needs.
Faster Delivery: Enables incremental releases, ensuring quicker time-to-market.
Risk Management: Identifies and resolves issues early through frequent testing.
Disadvantages:
Uncertain Scope: Continuous changes can make it difficult to define a fixed scope.
High Team Involvement: Requires constant communication and active stakeholder participation.
Difficult Cost Estimation: Changing requirements can make budgeting unpredictable.
Waterfall Methodology
Advantages:
Structured Approach: Follows a sequential process with clear documentation.
Predictability: Fixed scope, timeline, and budget allow for easier project planning.
Well-Suited for Large Projects: Ideal for projects with well-defined requirements.
Disadvantages:
Inflexibility: Difficult to accommodate changes once development begins.
Late Testing: Bugs and issues are identified late in the process, leading to costly fixes.
Longer Delivery Time: The final product is delivered at the end, delaying user feedback.
Key Differences
Agile is iterative and adaptive, while Waterfall is linear and sequential.
Agile welcomes changes, whereas Waterfall follows a fixed plan.
Agile requires continuous collaboration, while Waterfall focuses on upfront documentation.
Agile delivers working software incrementally, while Waterfall delivers the final product at the end.


## 4. In what types of projects might Agile be more beneficial than Waterfall, and vice versa? Can you provide examples of each?
When Agile is More Beneficial
Agile is ideal for projects that require flexibility, frequent iterations, and ongoing customer involvement. It works well in environments where requirements are expected to evolve.
